# MINIMAX BOT - Sam and Vivian

## There are four files in this folder.
- minimax.py 
    - runs the chess game by asking what move the human wants to make and printing the move made by the computer

- minimaxLib.py  
    - uses a for loop to search through each legal move and pick the best move based on the current state of the game

- singleSearch.py
    - same code and functions as minimaxLib but without recursion

- board.svg
    - updates the board for each move made by the computer or human

> To use this program, you only need to run minimax.py. 


If you want to see the gameboard, keep board.svg open -- it updates with each move!

'singleSearch' and 'minimaxLib' are both just function libraries.
